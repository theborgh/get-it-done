# Get It Done

Get It Done is an advanced Todo app that implements the "[Get Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)" methodology pioneered by David Allen. While the learning curve is steeper than a basic todo app, this system is a proven, effective, and stress-free way to collect, organize, and prioritize your tasks.
